### Formal Specification 


### Context

#### Pre-reading
Before reading this formal specification, implementers are encouraged to first familiarize themselves with two other key portions of this implementation guide:

* The [Use Cases & Overview](use-cases.html) page, which provides context for what this formal specification is trying to accomplish and will give a sense of both the business context and general process flow enabled by the formal specification below.

* The [Technical Background](technical-background.html) page, which provides information about the underlying specifications and recommends portions that must be read and understood to have necessary foundation to understand the constraints and usage guidance described here.


#### Conventions
This implementation guide uses specific terminology to flag statements that have relevance for the evaluation of conformance with the guide:

* **SHALL** indicates requirements that must be met to be conformant with the specification.

* **SHOULD** indicates behaviors that are strongly recommended (and which could result in interoperability issues or sub-optimal behavior if not adhered to), but which do not, for this version of the specification, affect the determination of specification conformance.

* **MAY** describes optional behaviors that implementers are free to consider but where there is no recommendation for or against adoption.


#### Systems
This implementation guide sets expectations for two types of systems:

* **REMS Clients** 

* **REMS Administration Services** 

#### Security and Privacy 

#### PHI/PII 

#### SMART on FHIR Hook Invocation 

#### Levels of REMS Administrator Integration
