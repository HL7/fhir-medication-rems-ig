### Pre-reading
Before reading this formal specification, implementers are encouraged to first familiarize themselves with other key portions of this implementation guide:

* The [Participant Roles and Needs](roles.html) section overviews the real world people and organizations who participate in REMS programs and defines the system roles referenced in the specification below.

* The [REMS Steps and Terminology](process.html) and [Use Cases](use-cases.html) sections describe the process context and goals behind the interactions defined below

* The [Technical Background](technical-background.html) page identifies related specifications that this guide depends on. 


### Conformance Conventions
This implementation guide uses the following terms to set expectations for implementers to conform to specific behaviors and information content it defines:

* **SHALL** indicates requirements that must be met to be conformant with the specification.

* **SHOULD** indicates behaviors that are strongly recommended (and which could result in interoperability issues or sub-optimal behavior if not adhered to), but which are not strictly required for an implementation to be considered conformant to this version of the guide.

* **MAY** describes optional behaviors that implementers are free to consider but where there is no recommendation for or against adoption.

### Provider System and REMS Administrator System Interactions

This implementation guide establishes two basic interaction patterns between a Provider System and REMS Administrator System that can be applied at multiple points in treating a patient with a REMS drug:
- **Preferred approach:** Interaction initiated by the Provider System during the provider's workflow
- **Additional / transitional approach**: Provider uses an external REMS Administrator application that accesses patient data in the Provider System using standalone SMART app launch. This provides a transitional bridge for REMS provider portals that exist today, and for circumstances where interaction with the REMS Administrator may more naturally occur within its external system.

#### Interaction initiated by the Provider System during the provider's workflow
This interaction is initiated by the Provider System during the provider's workflow, using CDS Hooks and, optionally, EHR-based SMART App Launch. 

- Provider Systems **SHALL** support this interaction approach because it offers the greatest opportunity to raise and address REMS requirements when related care activities occur. 
- REMS Administrators **SHOULD** implement this interaction approach.

#### Interaction between an external REMS Administrator application and the Provider System
In this interaction, a provider uses an external REMS Administrator application that accesses patient data in a Provider System using standalone SMART app launch. 

- Provider Systems **SHALL** support this interaction approach to provide a transitional bridge from REMS Administrator portals that exist today or for circumstances where interaction with the REMS Administrator may more naturally occur within its external system. 
- REMS Administrators **MAY** support this interaction approach.

#### CDS Hooks and SMART App Launch patterns may be applied at multiple points in a patient's care

The guide does not strictly require that either of these patterns be implemented at particular workflow events. Implementers are free to choose when and how they apply these interactions. However, implementers **SHOULD** support these interactions whenever possible to:

- notify the provider that a REMS program exists for a drug being considered or ordered
- alert the provider of unmet REMS requirements 
- provide information to educate the provider or patient, or assist with their REMS responsibilities 
- enroll the patient into the REMS program at the earliest opportunity
- make the provider aware of REMS requirements or information needs during the course of treatment
- supply the REMS Administrator with needed patient, provider or treatment information electronically from the Provider System--without human intervention--where possible, to reduce the burden on participants and prevent care delays
- and save REMS Administrator-supplied information about the patient's participation in the REMS program to the patient's record in the Provider System.

In particular, this guide strongly recommends leveraging the CDS Hooks and SMART app launch workflow at the start of the patient's therapy to raise patient enrollment requirements and enable them to be completed quickly, minimizing manual data entry and preventing a possible delay in treatment. 

<p></p>

#### Support for immediate provider actions in response to a REMS Interaction

Many EHRs support a subset of CDS Hooks and SMART launch features today to bring alerts and information into the prescriber's workflow at appropriate times--to be acted upon immediately. 

The guide makes use of these features to notify the prescriber of pertinent REMS information, for example that there's a REMS program for a drug being considered or that the prescriber's REMS enrollment has lapsed. The provider's response in these situations may be to simply acknowledge the information before continuing with their workflow.

A provider may also take the opportunity to complete a REMS requirement returned in a CDS Hooks response immediately through use of a SMART app. Use of the guide's patterns can minimize the time needed from the provider in such a circumstance--to complete a patient enrollment form, for example--by the REMS Administrator prefilling or hiding questions that were satisfied by data provided in the preceding CDS Hooks interaction. 

Provider Systems **SHALL** support immediate provider responses to Cards returned .

<p></p>

#### Support for deferred SMART app launch

In other cases, a provider action may not be able to be completed immediately upon receiving it in a CDS Hooks response, and instead may need to be deferred until a later time. The guide leverages an approach where the REMS Administrator's CDS Hooks response includes a `suggestion` Card containing a Task resource enabling the provider to launch the indicated SMART app later, as described in the [CDS Hooks Card Profiles section](cds-cards.html#deferred-smart-application-launch-suggestion).

Provider Systems **SHOULD** support `suggestion` cards with associated `actions` to defer the launch of SMART application, and **SHOULD** provide the REMS Administrator's CDS server sufficient OAuth scopes to enable the app to create a Task to enable the deferred launch, as [described here](cds-cards.html#deferred-smart-application-launch-suggestion).

<p></p>

#### Enabling the Provider System user to manually launch the SMART app

In some situations, it may be helpful for the prescriber or other provider assisting in the care of a REMS patient to manually launch the associated REMS Administrator SMART app, independent of a CDS Hooks interaction. 

Provider Systems and REMS Administrators **MAY** support manual launch of the REMS Administrator SMART application.

When a Provider System provides this support, it **SHALL** provide patient context during launch.

<p></p>

#### Support for saving REMS information to the patient's record

The REMS Administrator SMART app **MAY** save information about the patient's REMS participation to the Provider System's patient record. Saving of REMS information is typically most effective during the providerâ€™s interaction with a SMART app because it can be timed to occur after activities that might change the patient's status or information--for example by completing patient enrollment. 

To enable this to occur, the Provider System **SHOULD** authorize a REMS Administrator's SMART app with sufficient OAuth scopes to enable the app to create a DocumentReference resource associated to the patient. [This guidance in the SMART App Launch IG](https://hl7.org/fhir/smart-app-launch/scopes-and-launch-context.html) provides details for assigning scopes during app launch.

If using this capability, the REMS Administrators **SHOULD** follow [US Core DocumentReference guidance](https://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/StructureDefinition-us-core-documentreference.html) when creating this resource. 

In addition to the US Core requirements, this guide recommends populating DocumentReference.type with the LOINC value `51851-4` (Administrative note).

See an [example DocumentReference](DocumentReference-example-rems-docref-1.html) that illustrates this guidance.

<p></p>

#### Support for forwarding messages through Prescriber Intermediary

The Prescriber Intermediary server application sits in between the EHR system and the REMS Administrator. The benefit to this is allowing the REMS Administrator system to register their CDS Hooks with any supported intermediaries instead of every EHR system. The CDS Hooks requests are sent to the Prescriber Intermediary when configured to do so. This intermediary will determine based on the medication in the hook which REMS Administrator to send the request to. The intermediary will then forward back any returned cards from the REMS Administrator to the EHR. The interaction will be transparent to the EHR system. The intermediary **SHALL** populate the prefetch if unset using the prefetch tokens provided by the REMS Administrator. Lastly, the intermediary **SHALL** remove the FHIR Authorization from the Hook before sending it to the REMS Administrator.

The Prescriber Intermediary **SHOULD** also support forwarding FHIR requests from the EHR to the REMS Administrators. Similarly to the CDS Hooks requests, FHIR requests will be forwarded. This enables the `$rems-etasu` FHIR operation (for retrieving the ETASU out-of-band) and the `$questionnaire-package` operation (for retrieving Questionnaires in a shared SMART on FHIR application scenario).

<p></p>

#### Support for Shared SMART on FHIR Application 

Similar to the burden with registering the CDS Hook server on the REMS Administrator with every EHR, there is significant effort during setup to register the SMART on FHIR application from the REMS Administrator with every EHR. The REMS Administrators have the option to implement their own SMART on FHIR application that may give them tighter control, however REMS Administrators **SHOULD** support shared SMART App launch instead. The Shared SMART app **SHALL** follow the [Da Vinci Documentation Templates and Rules \(DTR\) IG](https://hl7.org/fhir/us/davinci-dtr/). 

##### Rendering the Shared SMART app
The shared SMART app **SHALL** request the resources necessary to render the forms from the REMS Administrators using the `$questionnaire-package` operation on the Questionnaire resource. The path to the operation on the REMS administrator's FHIR server will follow the pattern `<fhir_server_base>/Questionnaire/<questionnaire-id>/$questionaire-package`. When retrieving the questionnaire package, the REMS Administrator will compile a FHIR bundle containing the Questionnaire, ValueSet, and any Library resource needed to render the form. Embedded within Library resources there **SHOULD** be CQL (Clinical Quality Language) scripts. These scripts link the Questionnaire to data within the FHIR server. Once executed by the Shared SMART App, they are able to pre-populate the forms with data. Without the CQL, the forms will be empty when loading, negating the benefit of using a SMART on FHIR application.

##### Storing Completed Questionnaires
While the forms are being completed, the data **SHALL** be stored within a QuestionnaireResponse FHIR resource. The application **SHOULD** provide a method for storing and retrieving in-progress forms from the EHR FHIR server. Upon completion of the form, submission should send the QuestionnaireReponse to the correct REMS Administrator for the medication.

### Data Exchange During CDS Hooks Interactions
<p></p>

The REMS Administrator will typically need information about the patient, provider and drug to support a REMS interaction, regardless of the REMS program or point in the patient's care.

But individual programs may require sharing additional patient clinicals or other info with the REMS Administrator as part of the Hooks interaction so that it can determine how best to respond.

<p></p>

#### Prefetch

Supplying a consistent set of FHIR resources in the CDS Hooks request is needed to provide sufficient context to enable the REMS Administrator to respond--regardless of the medication or situation.

The Provider System **SHOULD** support include the following FHIR resources as prefetch data within CDS Hooks requests submitted to a REMS Administrator's CDS service. The REMS Administratorâ€™s CDS service **SHALL** query the Provider System to retrieve the resources below if not provided in the CDS request.
  - **Practitioner**, to identify the provider participating in the triggering event
  - **Patient**, to identify the patient being treated
  - **MedicationRequest** for the REMS drug (which may be draft or completed, depending on when the CDS request is triggered) and other patient medications
  - **Medication** if referenced by the MedicationRequest
  - **Pharmacy** (optional) requested pharmacy as represented by a HealthcareService resource

For example: 

{% raw %}
<pre class="json" style="white-space: pre;"><code class="language-json">{
  ...
    "prefetch" : {
      "patient": "Patient/{{context.patientId}}",
      "practitioner": "{{context.userId}}",
      "medicationRequests": "MedicationRequest?subject={{context.patientId}}&_include=MedicationRequest:medication",
    }
}</code></pre>
{% endraw %}

<p></p>

### Query During CDS Hooks
- In addition, the Provider System is expected to provide sufficient authorization during the CDS Hooks exchange to enable the REMS Administrator to retrieve related patient information including...
  - lab results
  - vital signs
  - conditions
  - concurrent and past medications
  - procedures
  - etc. 

Provider Systems **SHALL** enable the REMS Administrator to query for additional patient clinical or other information during the CDS exchange, for example to retrieve lab results or other diagnostics specific to a REMS drug program

<p></p>

### Out-of-band ETASU Check

There may be instances where a client to the REMS Administrator may want to know the current ETASU (Elements to Assure Safe Use) status of the REMS program at any given time. A new FHIR operation $rems-etasu on the GuidanceResponse resource **SHOULD** be supported by the REMS Administrator FHIR Server. This operation allows the clients to the REMS Administrator FHIR server to query the status of the REMS process for an individual patient at any time. The clients to this operation may include the EHR or Pharmacy applications. The users of these may include the Patient, Provider, or Pharmacist. The operation will also return the case number if available for the REMS case associated with the Patient and Medication input as Parameters. This operation allows for the systems to programmatically check the ETASU status in a parsable output format that can be displayed to the users in a graphical and more user-friendly method. The data can also be used to determine the case number for use when sending the Prescription to the Pharmacy using the NewRx NCPDP SCRIPT message.

#### Input 

The input parameters optionally consist of a Patient and Medication FHIR Resource or a case number. These resources are used by the REMS Administrator to retrieve the REMS case for the provided patient.

This GuidanceResponse represents the overall status of the REMS ETASU. Inside the GuidanceResponse there is a contained Parameters list named *etasuOutputParameters*. Each Parameter in this list contains a GuidanceResponse resource that is representative of one of the individual elements of the REMS program. These may include any forms or knowledge assessments that need to be completed. These parameters are referenced by the *outputParameters* field. The *status* of the GuidanceResponse values gives the completion status of the REMS ETASU requirement. The values are matched in the table above.

### Security and Privacy

#### FHIR Privacy and Security Guidance
Implementers are expected to...
- follow core [FHIR security principles](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/security.html).
 
- protect patient privacy as described in [FHIR Security and Privacy Considerations](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/secpriv-module.html).

<p></p>
  
#### REMS Workflow-Related Privacy and Security

Provider Systems and REMS Administrators **SHALL** follow guidance defined in...
- the CDS Hooks [Security and Safety](https://cds-hooks.hl7.org/2.0/#security-and-safety) section
- [SMART App Launch  Implementation Guide](https://hl7.org/fhir/smart-app-launch).

#### Prescriber Intermediary Security

The Prescriber Intermediary is useful for forwarding CDS Hooks requests from the EHR to the correct REMS Administrator. Passing the FHIR authorization on to a third party that was not registered with the EHR is a problem. Therefore, the FHIR authorization **shall** be stripped from the hook request before being forwarded to the REMS Administrator. This can leave a problem with the prefetch not properly being populated. In this case, the intermediary **shall** populate the prefetch using the FHIR authorization that it had stripped from the hook. This will provide all needed information to the REMS Administrator in order to process the hook request.
