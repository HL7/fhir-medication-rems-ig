### REMS Process Steps and Timeframes
REMS program requirements vary widely for different medications. Some programs focus on making providers and patients aware of potential risks, while others require additional steps, authorizations, reporting or other actions at the start of treatment or during ongoing therapy.

This IG uses the following set of timeframes and steps to provide context to its guidance. The aim is to provide enough detail to give direction and make necessary distinctions--but generalize enough so that references to a step or timeframe can cover the range of specific actions that participants might take for different REMS programs.
