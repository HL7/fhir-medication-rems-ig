Nearly all drug prescriptions in the United States are transmitted electronically to pharmacies. Those data exchanges and other related medication management interactions are conducted using a set of federal standards and other conventions that enable consistent, nationwide exchange.

This section: 
- overviews these e-prescribing interactions
- describes where REMS steps fit in
- provides guidance for integrating related FHIR and NCPDP SCRIPT exchanges


### REMS Within the Context of E-Prescribing

### Populating REMS IDs / etc. in the SCRIPT prescription

### Populating FHIR based on SCRIPT prescription data 
(e.g., for submission in a CDS request)

### Other Supporting SCRIPT Messages
e.g., pharmacy-to-prescriber request to complete unmet REMS requirements (RxChangeRequest)
