### Relationship to Da Vinci Burden Reduction IGs
Certain interactions between participants in the REMS process are similar to the provider / payer interactions described in the Da Vinci "Burden Reduction" IGs:

- Coverage Requirements Discovery (CRD)
- Documentation Templates and Rules (DTR)

This guide aims to be consistent where possible with FHIR conventions set in related implementation guides, and this section describes how approaches used in this guide relate to those employed in the Burden Reduction guides.

### Architectural Approach
#### Approach: Common Patterns to be Applied at Multiple Steps

This guide establishes two information sharing patterns that can be applied at multiple points in the REMS process outlined above:
- Information sharing within the provider system workflow (using CDS Hooks and EHR-based SMART App Launch)
- Patient information retrieval from an external REMS Administrator application (using standalone SMART app launch).
