### Consistency with the Da Vinci Burden Reduction IGs
Certain interactions between participants in the REMS process are similar to the provider / payer interactions described in the Da Vinci "Burden Reduction" IGs:

- [Coverage Requirements Discovery \(CRD\)](https://hl7.org/fhir/us/davinci-crd)
- [Documentation Templates and Rules \(DTR\)](https://hl7.org/fhir/us/davinci-dtr/)

This guide aims to be consistent where possible with FHIR conventions set in related implementation guides, and this section describes how approaches used in this guide relate to those employed in the Burden Reduction guides.


#### Use of CDS Hooks

The Da Vinci CRD Implementation Guide was used as the basis for this guide's [guidance on using CDS Hooks response Cards](cds-cards.html), with the goal of being as consistent as possible with the CRD IG's direction while providing direction that is tailored specifically to REMS workflows. The Card examples were minimally adjusted from examples in the CRD IG, only to the extent needed to illustrate REMS-related alerts, documentation and actions rather than the coverage-related information returned in CRD's scenarios. 

Note that the Da Vinci CRD specification outlines additional return types that are related to filling out forms using FHIR Questionnaires.  While there are no examples provided here, there is nothing within this specification that precludes the use of that return type for a REMS workflow.
