### Scenarios not covered in this guide
Support for the following scenarios is not included in this version of the implementation guide. They may be covered in future versions.

#### Patient Enrollment Using a Patient-Directed Portal
A provider prescribes a medication that has a REMS for a patient and fills out the required patient enrollment forms. The patient receives a notification to attest that they have received any required education/documentation required by the REMS as well as the accuracy of the information contained on the forms. 

The patient logs into their providers patient portal and launches an application to fill out the required information and submits the results back to the REMS Administration system.

#### Validate Pharmacy is Registered 
A provider prescribes a medication that has a REMS to a patient. The provider asks the patient what their preferred pharmacy is.  Before sending the prescription to the pharmacy, the ERM queries the REMS Administration systems to determine if the pharmacy is enrolled on the REMS if required and can dispense the medication.  The REMS Administration system sends back a notification stating if the pharmacy can dispense the medication.  An alert is displayed in the uI of the EMR if the pharmacy is incapable of dispensing the medication.
